## :memo: Game plan

### Above picture shows the outline of how my game page should look. 
1. First create a HTML file. 
2. Starting with h1/h2 which will be name of the game. 
3. Then create a section will contains the game board. 
4. Div class and id for each box of game board. (9 in total)
5. Next a winning message is placed which will tell us which player won.
6. Finally a reset button that will allow us to empty the box and start a new game.
