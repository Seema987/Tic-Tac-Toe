### Above picture shows the outline of how my game page should look. 

1. Starting with h1/h2 which will be name of th game and kind of welcome note. 
2. Next create two boxes with number of players. (In this case two players.)
3. When player click player1 button the player will be notified to use X.  Y if it's player2. 
4. Let's  get started then. 


![boxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seema987/Tic-Tac-Toe/main/IMG_9072.jpg) 


The tic-tac-toe board had 9 boxes all together. Each box is given a label of 1,2,3, and  so on. These label will be used to create a winning sequence in the Java Script. 

Next a winning message is placed which will tell us whill player won.

Finally a reset button that will allow us to empty the box and start a new game.
