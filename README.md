## :memo: Game plan
### :ghost: HTML Outline
1. :page_with_curl: First create a HTML file. 
2. Starting with h1 which will be name of the game. 
3. :1234: Then create a section will contains the game board. 
4. Div class and id for each box of game board. (9 in total)
5. Next a winning message is placed which will tell us which player won.
6. Finally a reset button that will allow us to empty the box and start a new game.

### :ghost: JavaScript Outline

1. document.querySelect all the necessary tags fromm HTML.  
2. Create an array with winning sequencce. 
3. Create an array which is going to store total user clicks. 
4. Create two seperate array to store clicks of player1 and 2. 
5. :loop: Create a loop that will go around the winning sequence and user clicks. 
6. Create an if else statement that will check if winner is player 1 or two. 
7. :mega: Add eventListener to all the boxes of game board. 
8. :tada: Give winning message for player 1 and 2 and also draw if there was no win. 
9. Finally make sure your reset button clears the existing game and allow you to start new game. 


### :bug: Bugs to fix 
1. :shit: When you click the reset button X and O are swapped. If X started first earlier, now O will be  starting first. This needs to be fixed if you wish X to start every game. And if you love the swap it's perfect. :innocent:
2. :boom: This game could have received mmore CSS features which is definitely my plan. Adding some sound effect, better background, and some cute little emojis. :kissing_smiling_eyes:
